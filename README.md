# Chicago City Parks

__Descripition__
The tiles I used are based around the geographic area of Chicago, Illinois. When creating the QMetaTiles from the parks shapefile and MapBox basemap I used a maximum zoom of 12. I chose this because I was focusing on a small area with a lot of small vector polygons. These polygons of the park areas needed to be clear and easy to identify, so I chose to increase the maximum zoom over what was recommened in lecture. Also, set the setView to the location identified as Chicago in google maps and set the zoom to 7 when opening the html. The setView was set to 7 becasue its gives the viewer a better idea of where this data is located relative to the surrounding US states. I set the extent to ChicagoParks layer because it was taking to long to create using a larger extent. I lived in Chicago when I was growing up and my favorite times were going to the parks throughout the city. It has always fasinated me with how many little spots there are to catch a of glimpse of nature surviving in major cities. <br/>
